# LABS

LABS is a database-driven website that makes equipment cataloguing and laboratory booking much easier for everyone involved. The project was developed for GEMS Modern Academy's Physics laboratory in 2019. Self-taught with the help of [Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
